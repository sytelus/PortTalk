PortTalk - Talk To TCP/IP Servers 

This 2 year old application is still the gem of it's own. You can use this program to connect to any TCP/IP server, send it some commands and see how server responds. I used this program to learn how exactly browser makes request for a page to HTTP server or how other TCP/IP protocols like Ping and Time works. I started out my TCP/IP programming journey by reading RFCs on different protocols and actually experimenting with them using PortTalk. I'd made even my own HTTP server and utilities like PortTalk were indispensible while testing them. The advanced version allows you to connect to to REA2 server (see below) and do a file transfer. This application is right now in state of easy clicks. You may freely contact me for assistance.
